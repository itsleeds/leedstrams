## Proprocessing

### Plan

-   Download the town map dataset from Scottish Library: https://maps.nls.uk/os/townplans-england/leeds2.html
-   Digitise the tramway centerlines from there
-   Digitise the tram network from Alex's image data
-   Combine both datasets into a single tramway network
-   Bonus: track lines
-   Comparing with OSM

### Town plan data

Individuals tiles can be accessed from URLs such as https://mapseries-tilesets.s3.amazonaws.com/os/town-england/North/19/259898/168840.png

This is raster 'tile pyramids' - zoom level 19, tile coordinates 259898, 168840.

The general pattern is: https://mapseries-tilesets.s3.amazonaws.com/os/town-england/North/{z}/{x}/{y}.png

You can copy-paste that URL into QGIS 'XYZ Tiles' to access the tiles directly as shown below:
